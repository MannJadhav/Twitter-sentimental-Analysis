# Twitter-sentimental-Analysis
Twitter sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Google Colab
Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweet sentiments. Using Python libraries, we build a model to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to run and modify.
Features

    1. Data Collection: Uses the Tweepy library to gather tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the text data by removing stop words, and punctuation, and applying tokenization.
    3. Sentiment Analysis: Implements various NLP techniques, including bag-of-words and TF-IDF, and machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or Random Forest.
    4. Visualization: Provides visual insights into the sentiment distribution using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/MannJadhav/Twitter-sentimental-Analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis

Open the Google Colab Notebook:
