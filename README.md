# Twitter-sentimental-Analysis
Twitter sentimental Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) using google colab
Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets. Using Python libraries, we build a model to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to run and modify.
Features

    Data Collection: Uses the Tweepy library to gather tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying tokenization.
    Sentiment Analysis: Implements various NLP techniques, including bag-of-words and TF-IDF, along with machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or Random Forest.
    Visualization: Provides visual insights into the sentiment distribution using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis

Open the Google Colab Notebook:
